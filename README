gtk-vikb
--------
This is an attempt to add vi keybindings to gtk text areas,
GtkTextView and GtkEntry.

The project was started 16 Jul 2012, so don't expect a lot
to work.

Building
--------
libgtk2.0-dev, libgtk3.0-dev or equivalent is required for successful building.

    $ make

Or limit the build to GTK version of your choice:

    $ make libvi-2
    $ make libvi-3

If you prefer, you can keep ESC behaving normally (closing dialogs, etc) and
have ALT-SPACE to leave insert mode to normal mode instead. This is
accomplished by compiling with:

	$ make "ALT_SPACE=1"

To try it out
-------------
GTK2_MODULES=<path-to-libvi-2.so> GTK3_MODULES=<path-to-libvi-3.so> [your-application]

For permanent use
-----------------
1) install module somewhere

	mkdir -p ~/.gtk-modules/modules
	cp libvi-2.so ~/.gtk-modules/modules/libvi.so

	mkdir -p ~/.gtk-modules/3.0.0/modules
	cp libvi-3.so ~/.gtk-modules/3.0.0/modules/libvi.so

2) add this to startup script (~/.xinitrc or whatever)

	export GTK_PATH=$HOME/.gtk-modules
	export GTK_MODULES=vi
